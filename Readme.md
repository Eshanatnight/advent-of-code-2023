# Advent of Code 2023

This is my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. I am using C++ and Rust to solve the problems. I use C++ on the odd days and Rust on the even days. I use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) as my build system for Rust and [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) as my build system for C++.

## How to run the solutions

Each problem has its own folder with the source code and the input file. To run the solutions, follow these steps:

- For C++ solutions, run `premake5 <action>` in the directory to generate the needed buildfiles. The executable files will be located in the `build/bin` folder. 

- For Rust solutions, run `cargo build` in the root directory to compile the source code. The executable files will be located in the `target/debug` folder. To run a specific solution, use `./target/debug/name`.

## About me

I am a software developer who enjoys solving puzzles and learning new things. I have been participating in the Advent of Code challenge since 2021. You can find more of my projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Eshanatnight).

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for creating the Advent of Code challenge and providing such fun and interesting problems.
